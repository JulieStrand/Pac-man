# Pac-man
## Pacman is looking for something to eat

<img src="pacman.png"><br>
This simple Pacman script shows a lonely Pacman chomping back and forth across the screen, looking for food. Right now he only moves back and forth along the x-axis, bounded by the window edges. This program is the basis for developing more complex versions with multiple Pacmen moving at random speeds, changing direction along both the x- and y-axes.
